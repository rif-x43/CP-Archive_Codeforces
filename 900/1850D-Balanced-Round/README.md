You are the author of a Codeforces round and have prepared $$ problems you are going to set, problem $$ having difficulty $$. You will do the following process: 

 - remove some (possibly zero) problems from the list;
- rearrange the remaining problems in any order you wish.

A round is considered *balanced* if and only if the absolute difference between the difficulty of any two consecutive problems is at most $$ (less or equal than $$).

What is the minimum number of problems you have to remove so that an arrangement of problems is balanced?

## Input

The first line contains a single integer $$ ($$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$ ($$) and $$ ($$) — the number of problems, and the maximum allowed absolute difference between consecutive problems.

The second line of each test case contains $$ space-separated integers $$ ($$) — the difficulty of each problem.

Note that the sum of $$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems you have to remove so that an arrangement of problems is balanced.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
7
5 1
1 2 4 5 6
1 2
10
8 3
17 3 1 20 12 5 17 12
4 2
2 4 6 8
5 3
2 3 19 10 8
3 4
1 10 5
8 1
8 3 1 4 5 10 7 3
```

**Output:**

```
2
0
5
0
3
1
4

```

## Note

For the first test case, we can remove the first $$ problems and construct a set using problems with the difficulties $$, with difficulties between adjacent problems equal to $$ and $$.

For the second test case, we can take the single problem and compose a round using the problem with difficulty $$.
