Calin has `n` buckets, the `i`-th of which contains `a_i` wooden squares of side length `1`.

Can Calin build a square using **all** the given squares?

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`) — the number of buckets.

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, …, a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`) — the number of squares in each bucket.

The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" if Calin can build a square using **all** of the given `1 × 1` squares, and "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`" and "`YES`" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
1
9
2
14 2
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
6
1 3 5 7 9 11
4
2 2 2 2
```

**Output:**

```
YES
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

## Note

In the first test case, Calin can build a `3 × 3` square.

In the second test case, Calin can build a `4 × 4` square.

In the third test case, Calin cannot build a square using all the given squares.
