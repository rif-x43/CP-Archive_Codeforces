You are given a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of lowercase letters.

In one operation, you can select an integer `i` such that `1≤ i < n` and change `s_i` into `s_i+1`.

What is the minimum number of operations needed to make every character the same? It can be proved that this is always possible.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 20`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`2≤ n≤ 100`) — the length of the string.

The following line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of lowercase letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `100`.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make every character the same.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
3
qwq
2
aa
4
test
5
abbac
6
abcabc
```

**Output:**

```
1
0
2
4
4
```

## Note

In the first test case, you can change `s_2` to `s_3` using `1` operation to reach the goal.

In the third test case, you can change `s_3` to `s_4` and then change `s_2` to `s_3`, using `2` operations in total. It can be proved that the answer is not less than `2`.
