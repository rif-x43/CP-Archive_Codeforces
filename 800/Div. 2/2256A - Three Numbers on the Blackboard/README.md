Rain is falling outside the Fairy Warehouse, so Chtholly, Nephren, and Ithea spend the afternoon playing a game in the common room.

Ithea writes three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` on the blackboard. 

Chtholly may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly zero):

 - Choose one of the three current integers and replace it with the sum of the other two current integers. The other two integers remain unchanged.

For example, starting from `(3,5,11)`, she can replace `11` with `3+5`, obtaining `(3,5,8)`.

Nephren wants to know the minimum range`^∗` of the three integers that Chtholly can obtain. Help her find it!

`^∗`The range of a non-empty finite collection of numbers is defined as its maximum value minus its minimum value. In particular, the range of three numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` is `max(x,y,z)-min(x,y,z)`.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (`0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ 10^9`) — the integers initially written on the blackboard.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible range of the three integers.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
5 5 5
4 6 9
2 3 10
0 0 7
2 3 5
20 4 5
```

**Output:**

```
0
5
3
0
3
5
```

## Note

In the first test case, all three integers are already equal, so their range is `0`.

In the second test case, performing no operation gives the range `9-4=5`. It can be shown that no sequence of operations can produce a smaller range.

In the third test case, Chtholly can replace `10` with `2+3=5`. The three integers become `(2,3,5)`, whose range is `5-2=3`.

In the fourth test case, Chtholly can replace `7` with `0+0=0`. All three integers then become `0`.
