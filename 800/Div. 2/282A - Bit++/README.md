The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.

The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called *x*. Also, there are two operations:

 - Operation `++` increases the value of variable *x* by 1.
- Operation `--` decreases the value of variable *x* by 1.

A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable *x*. The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters "`+`", "`-`", "`X`". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.

A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.

You're given a programme in language Bit++. The initial value of *x* is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

## Input

The first line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤ *n* ≤ 150) — the number of statements in the programme.

Next *n* lines contain a statement each. Each statement contains exactly one operation (`++` or `--`) and exactly one variable *x* (denoted as letter «`X`»). Thus, there are no empty statements. The operation and the variable can be written in any order.

## Output

Print a single integer — the final value of *x*.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
1
++X

```

**Output 1:**

```
1

```

**Example 2:**

```
2
X++
--X

```

**Output 2:**

```
0

```
