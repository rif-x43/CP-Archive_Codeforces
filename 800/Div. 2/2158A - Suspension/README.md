A game is being played which initially consists of `n` players. On fouls, the referee is allowed to award yellow and red cards. The total number of yellow cards `y` and red cards `r` awarded to players is known for the game.

There are `2` ways a player can be suspended: 

 - Receiving a red card.
- Receiving `2` yellow cards.

Once a player is suspended, they are removed from the game and can't receive any more cards. Determine the maximum number of players suspended from the game possible.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 500`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`).

The second line of each test case contains two integers `y` and `r` (`0 ≤ r ≤ n`, `0 ≤ y + r ≤ 2n`).

## Output

For each test case, print one line containing a single integer — denoting the maximum number of players suspended from the game possible.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
3
1 2
2
0 0
4
6 0
3
3 3
10
11 5
```

**Output:**

```
2
0
3
3
10
```

## Note

For the first test case: 

 - One of the possible ways to achieve maximum: Player `2` receives a red card, Player `3` receives a yellow card followed by a red card.
- This way Player `2` and `3` are suspended.

For the second test case: 

 - No cards are awarded at all, so no one is suspended.

For the third test case: 

 - One of the possible ways to achieve maximum: Player `1` receives `2` yellow cards, Player `2` receives `2` yellow cards, and Player `4` receives `2` yellow cards.
- This way Player `1`, `2`, and `4` are suspended.
