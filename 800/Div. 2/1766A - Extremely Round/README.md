Let's call a positive integer *extremely round* if it has only one non-zero digit. For example, `5000`, `4`, `1`, `10`, `200` are extremely round integers; `42`, `13`, `666`, `77`, `101` are not.

You are given an integer `n`. You have to calculate the number of extremely round integers `x` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n`.

## Input

The first line contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

Then, `t` lines follow. The `i`-th of them contains one integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 999999`) — the description of the `i`-th test case.

## Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of extremely round integers `x` such that `1 ≤ x ≤ n`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
9
42
13
100
111
```

**Output:**

```
9
13
10
19
19

```
