*Those cling-on troubles that ride my stride — cough up the fee, or step aside.*— SHUN, *TAKE IT AWAY*For a permutation`^∗` `r` of length `m`, we call an index `i` (`1≤ i≤ m`) *ugly* if and only if `i=max({r_1,r_2,…,r_i})`.

Simons has a permutation `p` of length `n`, and he can perform the following operation on `p` **at most once**:

 - Choose two indices `i` and `j` (`1≤ i≠ j≤ n`), then swap `p_i` and `p_j`.

Find a permutation `q` that can be obtained from `p` by performing the above operation at most once, such that the number of *ugly* indices in `q` is minimized.

`^∗`A permutation of length `n` is an array consisting of `n` distinct integers from `1` to `n` in arbitrary order. For example, `[2,3,1,5,4]` is a permutation, but `[1,2,2]` is not a permutation (`2` appears twice in the array), and `[1,3,4]` is also not a permutation (`n=3` but there is `4` in the array).

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line contains an integer `n` (`1≤ n≤ 500`) — the length of `p`.

The second line contains `n` integers `p_1,p_2,…,p_n` (`1≤ p_i≤ n`, all `p_i`-s are distinct) — the elements of `p`.

## Output

For each test case, print `n` integers `q_1,q_2,…,q_n` — the permutation you found.

If there are multiple possible permutations, you may output any.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
2
1 2
4
2 3 1 4
5
3 2 4 5 1
1
1
8
4 1 3 2 6 7 8 5
```

**Output:**

```
2 1
2 4 1 3
3 2 4 5 1
1
4 1 3 8 6 7 2 5
```

## Note

In the first test case, Simons can obtain only two possible permutations: `[1,2]` and `[2,1]`.

 - For permutation `[1,2]`, we can see `1=max({1})` and `2=max({1,2})`. So there are two *ugly* indices.
- For permutation `[2,1]`, we can see `1≠max({2})` and `2=max({2,1})`. So there is only one *ugly* index.

Thus, permutation `[2,1]` has the minimum count of *ugly* indices.

In the second test case, Simons can obtain permutation `[2,4,1,3]` by choosing indices `2` and `4` to swap. There is only one *ugly* index in the permutation:

 - `1≠ max({2})`, so index `1` is not *ugly*;
- `2≠ max({2,4})`, so index `2` is not *ugly*;
- `3≠ max({2,4,1})`, so index `3` is not *ugly*;
- `4=max({2,4,1,3})`, so index `4` is *ugly*.

In the third test case, note that Simons does not perform the operation.
