You are given an integer `n`, which you want to obtain. You have an unlimited supply of every integer from `1` to `k`, except integer `x` (there are no integer `x` at all).

You are allowed to take an arbitrary amount of each of these integers (possibly, zero). Can you make the sum of taken integers equal to `n`?

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains three integers `n, k` and `x` (`1 ≤ x ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100`).

## Output

For each test case, in the first line, print "`YES`" or "`NO`" — whether you can take an arbitrary amount of each integer from `1` to `k`, except integer `x`, so that their sum is equal to `n`.

If you can, the second line should contain a single integer `m` — the total amount of taken integers. The third line should contain `m` integers — each of them from `1` to `k`, not equal to `x`, and their sum is `n`.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
10 3 2
5 2 1
4 2 1
7 7 3
6 1 1
```

**Output:**

```
YES
6
3 1 1 1 1 3
NO
YES
2
2 2
YES
1
7
NO

```

## Note

Another possible answer for the first testcase is `[3, 3, 3, 1]`. Note that you don't have to minimize the amount of taken integers. There also exist other answers.

In the second testcase, you only have an unlimited supply of integer `2`. There is no way to get sum `5` using only them.

In the fifth testcase, there are no integers available at all, so you can't get any positive sum.
