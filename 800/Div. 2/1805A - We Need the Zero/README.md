There is an array `a` consisting of non-negative integers. You can choose an integer `x` and denote `b_i=a_i ⊕ x` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, where `⊕` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Is it possible to choose such a number `x` that the value of the expression `b_1 ⊕ b_2 ⊕ … ⊕ b_n` equals `0`?

It can be shown that if a valid number `x` exists, then there also exists `x` such that (`0 ≤ x < 2^8`).

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of the test case contains one integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`) — the length of the array `a`.

The second line of the test case contains `n` integers — array `a` (`0 ≤ a_i < 2^8`).

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^3`.

## Output

For each set test case, print the integer `x` (`0 ≤ x < 2^8`) if it exists, or `-1` otherwise.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
3
1 2 5
3
1 2 3
4
0 1 2 3
4
1 2 2 3
1
1
```

**Output:**

```
6
0
3
-1
1

```

## Note

In the first test case, after applying the operation with the number `6` the array `b` becomes `[7, 4, 3]`, `7 ⊕ 4 ⊕ 3 = 0`.

There are other answers in the third test case, such as the number `0`.
