You have a prize wheel divided into `l` sections, numbered from `0` to `l-1`. The sections are arranged in a circle, so after section `l-1`, the numbering continues again from section `0`.

Initially, the prize pointer is at section `a`. Each time you spin the wheel, the pointer moves exactly `b` sections forward. That is, after one spin, the pointer moves from section `a` to section `(a+b)mod l`, after two spins to `(a+2b)mod l`, and so on`^∗`.

You may spin the wheel any number of times (including zero). After you stop, the section where the pointer finally lands determines your prize: you receive an amount equal to the number of that section.

What is the maximum prize you can obtain?

`^∗`Here, `x mod y` denotes the remainder from dividing `x` by `y`.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 500`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains three integers `l, a`, and `b` (`1 ≤ l, b ≤ 5000`, `0 ≤ a ≤ l-1`).

## Output

For each test case, output the maximum prize that can be obtained.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
5 3 2
2 0 6
8 2 4
100 0 1
```

**Output:**

```
4
0
6
99
```

## Note

In the first test case, by spinning the wheel three times and then claiming the reward, you can obtain a maximum value of `4`. The sequence of pointer positions is: `3, 0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, …`

In the second test case, the pointer will remain on section `0` indefinitely.

In the fourth test case, with `b = 1` and starting from section `0`, the pointer will iterate over all sections, including the last one.
