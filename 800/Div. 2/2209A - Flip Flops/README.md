OtterZ set up a battle with `n` monsters in order to increase his combat power. Each monster has a combat power `a_i` and OtterZ has a combat power of `c`. He has `k` flip flops and can perform the following operations: 

 - Kill an alive monster `i` if `a_i ≤ c`; then `c` becomes `c + a_i`.
- Throw a flip flop at an alive monster `i`; the flip-flop will be broken and the monster will become angrier, then `a_i` becomes `a_i + 1`.

 Help OtterZ obtain the maximum possible `c` after the battle.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 500`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains three integers `n`, `c` and `k` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `0 ≤ c,k ≤ 10 ^ 9`).

The second line contains `n` integers `a_1,a_2,…,a_n` (`0≤ a_i≤ 10 ^ 9`).

## Output

For each test case, output an integer — the maximum possible combat power.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
10
1 12 23
21
1 8 4
5
1 3 4
16
3 6 3
14 9 11
5 9 2
20 16 18 16 11
5 18 30
1 2 93 84 2
7 29 13
2 9 38 4 7 1 6
10 9 2
8 1 8 11 17 3 14 16 20 10
10 192 109
1 9 20 9 829 3 87 1 283 7
10 1000000000 1000000000
19 1000000000 1 9 2 3 8 1 2 3
```

**Output:**

```
12
16
3
6
9
53
109
119
721
3000000048
```

## Note

In the first test,OtterZ found a strong monster and ran away, with combat power `12`.

In the sixth test, OtterZ participated in the battle: 

 - Throw `10` flip flops to monster `2`, the combat power of monster `2` turns to `12`.
- Throw `10` flip flops to monster `1`, the combat power of monster `1` turns to `11`.
- Kill monster `1`, OtterZ's combat power turns to `29`.
- Throw `10` flip flops to monster `5`, the combat power of monster `5` turns to `12`.
- Kill monster `2`, OtterZ's combat power turns to `41`.
- Kill monster `5`, OtterZ's combat power turns to `53`.
- OtterZ runs away with combat power `53`.
