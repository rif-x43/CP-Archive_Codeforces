Mocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive integers as a gift.

Mocha thinks that for an array of positive integers `a`, it is *good* iff the greatest common divisor of all the elements in `a` is no more than its length. And for an array of at least `2` positive integers, it is *beautiful* iff all of its prefixes whose length is no less than `2` are good. 

For example:

 - `[3,6]` is not good, because `gcd(3,6)=3` is greater than its length `2`.
- `[1,2,4]` is both good and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than `2`, which are `[1,2]` and `[1,2,4]`, are both good.
- `[3,6,1]` is good but not beautiful, because `[3,6]` is not good.

Now Mocha gives you the gift array `a` of `n` positive integers, and she wants to know whether array `a` could become beautiful by reordering the elements in `a`. It is allowed to keep the array `a` unchanged.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1≤ t≤ 500`). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (`2≤ n≤ 100`) — the length of array `a`.

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1,a_2,…,a_n` (`1≤ a_1,a_2,…,a_n≤ 10^6`) — the elements of array `a`.

## Output

For each test case, print `Yes` if it is possible to reorder the elements in `a` to make it beautiful, and print `No` if not.

You can output `Yes` and `No` in any case (for example, strings `yEs`, `yes`, `Yes` and `YES` will be recognized as a positive response).

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
2
3 6
3
1 2 4
3
3 6 1
3
15 35 21
4
35 10 35 14
5
1261 227821 143 4171 1941
```

**Output:**

```
No
Yes
Yes
No
Yes
Yes

```

## Note

In the first test case, neither `[3,6]` nor `[6,3]` are beautiful, so it's impossible to obtain a beautiful array by reordering the elements in `a`.

In the second test case, `[1,2,4]` is already beautiful. Keeping the array `a` unchanged can obtain a beautiful array.
