You are given two positive integers `a` and `b`. In one move you can increase `a` by `1` (replace `a` with `a+1`). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make `a` divisible by `b`. It is possible, that you have to make `0` moves, as `a` is already divisible by `b`. You have to answer `t` independent test cases.

## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases. Then `t` test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains two integers `a` and `b` (`1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`).

## Output

For each test case print the answer — the minimum number of moves you need to do in order to make `a` divisible by `b`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
10 4
13 9
100 13
123 456
92 46

```

**Output:**

```
2
5
4
333
0

```
