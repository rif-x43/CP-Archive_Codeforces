AksLolCoding is playing a game on an array `a` of `n` positive integers. During each turn:

 - If `a` is **non-decreasing**`^∗`, the game ends.
- Otherwise, AksLolCoding can choose **any** single element and remove it from the array.

Determine the **minimum** possible number of elements that can be remaining in the array after the game ends.

`^∗``a` is non-decreasing if `a_i≤ a_i+1` for all `1≤ i≤ m-1`, where `m` is the length of `a`.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`), the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10`).

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers, the elements of `a` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`).

## Output

For each test case, output an integer: the minimum possible number of elements left once the array is sorted.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
4
1 4 2 3
1
100
2
6 7
```

**Output:**

```
1
1
2
```

## Note

In the first test case, the minimum of `1` element can be achieved by removing `1`, `2`, and `3` in that order.

In the second and third test cases, no elements can be removed.
