Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes: `1`, `4`, `8`, `9`, ....

For a given number `n`, count the number of integers from `1` to `n` that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such `x` that `x` is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 20`) — the number of test cases.

Then `t` lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`).

## Output

For each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from `1` to `n` that Polycarp likes.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
10
1
25
1000000000
999999999
500000000

```

**Output:**

```
4
1
6
32591
32590
23125

```
