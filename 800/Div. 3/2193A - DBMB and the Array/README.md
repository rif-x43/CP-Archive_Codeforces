DBMB had a birthday yesterday. He was gifted an array `a` of `n` elements and a number `x`. But there is one problem: he only likes arrays where the sum of the elements equals `s`. To make the array appealing to him, you can perform the following operation any number of times: 

 - Choose an index `i` (`1 ≤ i ≤ n`) and add `x` to the number `a_i`.

 For example, if he was given the array `[1, 2, 3, 5]` and `x = 2`, you can choose index `3` and get the array `[1, 2, 5, 5]`. Your task is to determine whether the array can appeal to DBMB after any number of operations.

## Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of test cases. The following describes the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers `n`, `s`, `x` (`1 ≤ n, x ≤ 10`, `1 ≤ s ≤ 100`).

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, … a_n` (`1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10`) — the elements of the array gifted to DBMB.

## Output

For each test case, output "`YES`" if the array can appeal to DBMB. Otherwise, output "`NO`".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will be accepted as a positive answer.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
3 3 5
1 1 1
3 8 2
1 2 3
4 7 2
1 1 1 1
3 15 1
2 4 10
2 100 5
4 6
5 12 1
1 2 2 3 2
```

**Output:**

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES
YES
```

## Note

In the second test case, `a = [1, 2, 3]`, applying the operation on `a_2` gives us `a = [1, 4, 3]`. The sum of the array equals `s`.
