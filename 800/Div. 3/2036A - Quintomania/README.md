Boris Notkin composes melodies. He represents them as a sequence of notes, where each note is encoded as an integer from `0` to `127` inclusive. The interval between two notes `a` and `b` is equal to `|a - b|` semitones.

Boris considers a melody *perfect* if the interval between each two adjacent notes is either `5` semitones or `7` semitones.

After composing his latest melodies, he enthusiastically shows you his collection of works. Help Boris Notkin understand whether his melodies are *perfect*.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) — the number of melodies.

Each melody is described by two lines. 

The first line contains an integer `n` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 50`) — the number of notes in the melody.

The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (`0 ≤ a_i ≤ 127`) — the notes of the melody.

## Output

For each melody, output "`YES`", if it is *perfect*; otherwise, output "`NO`".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will be recognized as positive responses.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
