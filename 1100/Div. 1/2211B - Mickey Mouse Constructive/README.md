Given an array `a`, let `f(a)` be the number of ways to partition `a` into one or more subarrays`^∗` such that:

 - Each element appears in exactly one subarray.
- All subarrays have the same sum.

For example, if `a=[1,1]`, then `f(a)=2`, because there are two such ways to partition `[1,1]`:

 - `[1,1]`, where the only subarray has sum `2`.
- `[1]+[1]`, where both subarrays have sum `1`.

You are given two integers `x` and `y`. Find the minimum value of `f(a)` over all arrays `a` of length `x+y`, consisting of `x` copies of the number `1`, and `y` copies of the number `-1` in some order. Since this answer may be large, output the answer modulo `676 767 677`. Additionally, you should construct one array that achieves this minimal value.

`^∗`An array `b` is a subarray of an array `c` if `b` can be obtained from `c` by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains two integers `x` and `y` (`0 ≤ x,y ≤ 2· 10^5`). It is guaranteed that `x+y ≥ 1`.

It is guaranteed that the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed `2· 10^5`, and the sum of `y` over all test cases does not exceed `2· 10^5`.

## Output

For each test case, output two lines: the minimum value of `f(a)` over all valid arrays `a` modulo `676 767 677`, and an example of an array that achieves the minimal result. Note you are minimizing `f(a)`, and taking that minimum value modulo `676 767 677`, not finding the minimal possible result of `f(a)` mod `676 767 677`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
2 0
1 1
6 7
1 3
```

**Output:**

```
2
1 1
1
1 -1
1
-1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1
2
-1 -1 -1 1

```

## Note

In the first test case, `x=2` and `y=0`. The only possible array is `a=[1,1]`, with `f(a)=2` as explained above.

In the second case, `x=1` and `y=1`. One possible array that minimizes `f(a)` is `a=[1,-1]`, where `f(a)=1` (as the only way to partition into subarrays with all subarrays having equal sum is `[[1,-1]]`).
