Milkcat2009 has a matrix `a` with `n` rows and `m` columns consisting of integers `0` and `1`. The rows are numbered from `1` to `n`, and the columns are numbered from `1` to `m`. The element in the `i`-th row and `j`-th column is denoted as `a_i,j`.

Milkcat2009's AI scans every single submatrix`^∗` of `a` consisting of `r` rows and `c` columns. The AI considers the matrix *clean* if the bitwise XOR sum of elements in each such submatrix is equal to `0`.

Formally, the matrix `a` is valid if and only if for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n - r + 1` and `1 ≤ j ≤ m - c + 1`: `oplus_x=i^i+r-1 oplus_y=j^j+c-1 a_x,y = 0`

where `⊕` denotes summation with the bitwise XOR operation.

Your task is, given various sets of integers `n, m, r, c`, to count the number of *clean* matrices of `n` rows and `m` columns with respect to scanning dimensions `r` and `c`. Since the answer can be very large, calculate it modulo `998 244 353`.

`^∗`A submatrix of a matrix is obtained by removing some rows (from the beginning and/or end) and/or columns (from the beginning and/or end) from the original matrix.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing four integers `n, m, r, c` (`1 ≤ r ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `1 ≤ c ≤ m ≤ 10^9`), representing the dimensions of the matrix and the dimensions of the scanning area, respectively.

## Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the answer modulo `998 244 353`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
8
1 1 1 1
2 3 1 2
2 5 2 2
3 5 2 2
4 6 2 2
100 14 52 6
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1 1
```

**Output:**

```
1
4
64
128
512
543661425
121099884
1
```

## Note

For the first test case. The only element `a_1,1` must satisfy `a_1,1 = 0`. Since `a_1,1` must be `0`, there is only `1` valid matrix: `[0]`.

For the second test case.The condition requires the XOR sum of every `1 × 2` submatrix to be `0`. This implies `a_i,j ⊕ a_i,j+1 = 0`, so `a_i,j = a_i,j+1` for all valid `i,j`. For each row, all elements must be equal. Thus, each row can be either `[0, 0, 0]` or `[1, 1, 1]`. With `2` rows, there are `2^2 =4` valid matrices.
