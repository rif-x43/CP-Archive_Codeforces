You have a group of `n` students who need access to an online course. Two types of access keys are available in the store:

 - **Individual key:** costs `a` dollars and gives access to **one** student.
- **Group key:** costs `b` dollars and gives access to a group of up to **three** students inclusive.

A group key can also be used for fewer students (one or two), and its price does not change.

Your task is to determine the **minimum** amount of money needed to provide access to the online course for all `n` students.

## Input

The first line contains one integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers `n, a, b` (`1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^8`) — the number of students, the cost of an individual key, and the cost of a group key.

## Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum amount of money needed to provide access to the online course for all `n` students.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
9
5 10 25
4 10 50
1 20 15
1 10 25
100000000 100 290
2 10 15
300 1 1
4 10 12
11 10 20
```

**Output:**

```
45
40
15
10
9666666670
15
100
22
80
```

## Note

In the first example, you can buy `1` group key and `2` individual keys.

In the second example, you can buy `4` individual keys.

In the third example, you can buy `1` group key.

In the fourth example, you can buy `1` individual key.
