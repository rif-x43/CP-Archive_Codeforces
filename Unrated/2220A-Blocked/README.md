Given an array $a$ of integers of size $n$, we say that a position $1≤i≤n$ is *blocked* if $ai$ can be expressed as the sum of a subset of $a1,a2,…,ai−1$ (i.e. there exist $1≤j1<j2<…<jk≤i−1$ such that $aj1+aj2+…+ajk=ai$). Reorder $a$ so that no position is blocked or report that it is impossible.

For example, reordering the array [$3,2,5$] to [$2,3,5$] makes position $3$ blocked, since we can express $5=2+3$, but if we reorder it to [$3,5,2$], no position is blocked.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1≤t≤400$). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1≤n≤200$).

The second line contains $n$ integers, denoting the array $a$ ($1≤ai≤100$).

## Output

For each test case, print any order of $a$ such that no position is blocked if it exists, otherwise print $−1$.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
3
1 5 9
4
1 3 3 2
3
1 2 3
1
1

```

**Output:**

```
5 9 1
-1
3 1 2
1
```

## Note

In the third test case, the array [$3,1,2$] has no position blocked:

Position $1$ is not blocked since $3$ can't be expressed as the sum of a subset of [].

Position $2$ is not blocked since $1$ can't be expressed as the sum of a subset of [$3$].

Position $3$ is not blocked since $2$ can't be expressed as the sum of a subset of [$3,1$].
